If you end up hosting TAG, you can handle it in any way you want under two conditions.\\r\\nYou must keep the 4 core rules outlined below by linking to this page. This maintains the legitimacy of the jam by identifying you officially as current host and prevents non-tagged people from hosting.\\r\\nThere must be 2 randomly generated themes, the last theme is chosen by you.\\r\\nOther than that you are free to decide how people join and how submissions are rated\\/handled, and any further rules\\/restrictions you want to place on participants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4 Core Rules\\r\\nSubmissions must come in within 12 hours of the Gamejam ending.\\r\\nSubmissions must be original works, no plagiarism.\\r\\nSubmissions can be based on any number of themes, but must incorporate at least 1 of the randomly generated themes.\\r\\nNo Pressure. Just have fun with it.
